## Project #1: Flight Time

From SoloLearn:
>You need to calculate the flight time of an upcoming trip. You are flying from LA to Sydney, covering a distance of 7425 miles, the plane flies at an average speed of 550 miles an hour.
>
>Calculate and output the total flight time in hours.
>
>Hint
>The result should be a float.
>Use the print statement to output the result.

## Project #2: Leaderboard

From SoloLearn:
>You need to make a program for a leaderboard.
>The program needs to output the numbers 1 to 9, >each on a separate line, followed by a dot:
>1.
>2.
>3.
>...
>You can use the \n newline character to create line breaks, or, alternatively, create the desired output using three double quotes """.

## Project #3: Tip Calculator

From SoloLearn:
>When you go out to eat, you always tip 20% of the bill amount. But who’s got the time to calculate the right tip amount every time? Not you that’s for sure! You’re making a program to calculate tips and save some time.
>
>Your program needs to take the bill amount as input and output the tip as a float.
>
>Sample Input
>50
>
>Sample Output
>10.0
>Explanation: 20% of 50 is 10.
>To calculate 20% of a given amount, you can multiply the number by 20 and divide it by 100: 50*20/100 = 10.0

## Project #4: BMI Calculator

From SoloLearn:
>Tracking your BMI is a useful way of checking if you’re maintaining a healthy weight. It’s calculated using a person's weight and height, using this formula: weight / height²
>
>The resulting number indicates one of the following categories:
>Underweight = less than 18.5
>Normal = more or equal to 18.5 and less than 25
>Overweight = more or equal to 25 and less than 30
>Obesity = 30 or more
>
>Let’s make finding out your BMI quicker and easier, by creating a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and outputs the corresponding BMI category.
>
>Sample Input
>85
>1.9
>
>Sample Output
>Normal
>Weight is in kg, height is in meters.
>Note, that height is a float.

## Project #5: Sum of Consecutive Numbers

From SoloLearn:
>No one likes homework, but your math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.
>
>Let’s save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you!
>
>Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).
>
>Sample Input
>100
>
>Sample Output
>5050
>
>Explanation: The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is equal to 5050.
>You can iterate over a range and calculate the sum of all numbers in the range.
>Remember, range(a, b) does not include b, thus you need to use b+1 to include b in the range.

## Project #6: Search Engine

From SoloLearn:
>The given code takes a text and a word as input and passes them to a >function called search().
>
>The search() function should return "Word found" if the word is >present in the text, or "Word not found", if it’s not.
>
>Sample Input
>"This is awesome"
>"awesome"
>
>Sample Output
>Word found
>Define the search() function, so that the given code works as expected.
